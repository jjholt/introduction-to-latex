    \section{Logarithmns}
    Perhaps the numbers most easy to provide irrational are certain logarithmns.
    Here is a proof by contradiction that \( \log_2 3 \) is irrational ( \( \log_2 3 \approx 1.58 > 0 \) ).

    Assume \( \log_2 3 \) is rational. For some positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \log_2 3 = \frac{m}{n}.
    \end{equation*}
    It follows that
    \begin{align*}
        2^{m/n} = 3 \\
        {(2^{m/n})}^n = 3^n \\
        2^m = 3^n.
    \end{align*}
