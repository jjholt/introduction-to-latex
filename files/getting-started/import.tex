\subsection{Importing bitmap graph}
The simplest method to import get your Octave/Matlab graphs onto a document is to export them to a bitmap picture, and import like we did before.

Our code looks something like the following\footnotemark, and the full example is in \verb|Examples/Importing-graphs|.
\lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, caption={\texttt{Importing-graphs/bitmap/example.m}}]{Examples/Importing-graphs/bitmap/bitmap-code.m}
\footnotetext{You may notice the figure is exported to \texttt{.eps}, not \texttt{.png}, \texttt{.tiff} or something otherwise more common. For that you may want to look into \href{https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig}{\texttt{export\_fig}}.}

Then, to include the graph, we simply use \verb|\includegraphics|.
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/example.eps}
\end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
Below you can see the output compared to something natively drawn with pgfplots.
It is a deliberately simple graph that can be easily replicated natively, but it highlights that font sizes and other small issues can become problematic for legibility.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.50\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Examples/Importing-graphs/bitmap/figures/example.eps}
    \caption{Matlab}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[]
        \begin{axis}[xlabel= \( x \), ylabel = \( f(x) \),
            ymax=1, ymin=-1, xmin=0 ]
            \addplot[domain=0:2*pi, samples=100, blue] {sin(deg(x))};
            \legend{ \( f(x) = \sin(x)  \) }
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Natively rendered}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

So what can we do instead? We can generate the graphs in Octave/Matlab and export the data for \texttt{tikz} and \texttt{pgfplots} to natively render it.
We have two options to do so: \texttt{matlab2tikz} and exporting to a \texttt{.svg} file.

\paragraph{Challenge:}
Replicate the sinusoidal graph with \texttt{pgfplots}, and you might see a straight line, indicating that it uses degrees, not radians.
Try to search for the solution!
Hopefully you will run into \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/16232/how-to-plot-fx-sinx-kx-cosx-and-ux-x%C2%B2-with-tikz}{this} link.

\subsection{Matlab2tikz}
This is an outstanding script written by Nico Schl√∂mer which can be downloaded from Mathworks' \href{https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022-matlab2tikz-matlab2tikz}{file exchange}, or directly from the \href{https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz}{github}. Please refer to the installation on the github page, if you are unfamiliar with installing external matlab functions.
In short, use Set Path, \verb|addpath| or see Figure \ref{fig:setpath} to include the downloaded \verb|src/| to your path.

\end{figure}

Usage is very similar to exporting a bitmap image, the only difference is that we get a \texttt{.tex} to import, which can be further edited if you really want to:

\lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, caption={\texttt{Importing-graphs/matlab2tikz/mat2tikz.m}}]{Examples/Importing-graphs/matlab2tikz/mat2tikz.m}

Importing requires a few packages and settings, as can be seen below.
The information is extracted from \texttt{matlab2tikz}'s github, and reading their \href{https://github.com/matlab2tikz/matlab2tikz/wiki/FAQ}{FAQ} may be very helpful 

The code is not separated into preamble and content, but it should be clear what goes where.
Importantly, the whole example can be found in \texttt{Examples/Importing-graphs}.
\lstinputlisting[language=tex, caption={\texttt{Importing-graphs/matlab2tikz/totikz.tex}}]{Examples/Importing-graphs/matlab2tikz/totikz.tex}
Resulting in:
\begin{figure}[h]\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
    \newlength\fheight{} \newlength\fwidth{}
    \setlength\fheight{5.5cm}
    \setlength\fwidth{7cm}    
\input{Examples/Importing-graphs/matlab2tikz/figures/graph.tex}
\caption{Matlab generated and rendered natively.}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[]
        \begin{axis}[xlabel= \( x \), ylabel = \( f(x) \),
            ymin=-1, xmin=0, ymax=1,]
            \addplot[domain=0:2*pi, samples=100, blue] {sin(deg(x))};
            \legend{ \( f(x) = \sin(x)  \) }
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Generated with \texttt{pgfplots}.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Note:}
Do you know why the fonts look still different?
In the graph generated by matlab, we did not tell it to render using math mode, i.e. f(x) vs \( f(x) \).

\subsection{Importing vector graph}
Occasionally the graphs produced in Octave/Matlab are complicated enough that they don't render very well with \texttt{matlab2tikz}.
In those cases, the plot is exported to a scalable vector format (\texttt{.svg}), then Inkscape produces a special \texttt{.pdf} which gets imported into our document.
What is special about this \texttt{.pdf} is that the fonts are rendered natively in \LaTeX.

Briefly about \href{https://inkscape.org/}{Inkscape}: it's a free and open source vector editor, serving a similar purpose to Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, etc.
You might find that it serves all your vector needs, and it's definitely worth exploring.
For our purposes, you can get away with simply using it to Save As \texttt{.pdf} and small tweaks to the graph.

The tool we will use is \href{https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7401-scalable-vector-graphics-svg-export-of-figures}{plot2svg} developed by Juerg Schwizer.
Installation is the same as before --- download plot2svg, then add the \texttt{src/} to your path, and you're ready.

\subsubsection{Generating the graph}
The example in full is available in \texttt{Examples/Importing-graphs/vector}.
With the code below, we produce both a \texttt{.svg} and a \texttt{.tex} to be imported.

\lstinputlisting[language=Matlab, caption={\texttt{Importing-graphs/vector/surface.m}}]{Examples/Importing-graphs/vector/surface.m}

It's worth highlighting that you can get matlab to interpret \LaTeX\ syntax with the options shown above.
This is great if you're either exporting the bitmap image or the \texttt{.tex} file.
With \texttt{.pdf\_tex}, you cannot have matlab interpret the latex, and therefore need to play around with getting math mode using \verb|\( \)|.

\subsubsection{Converting to \texttt{.pdf\_tex}}
Now we can open the \texttt{.svg} in inkscape, Save As \texttt{.pdf} and choose to ``omit text in PDF and create LaTeX file''.
Generally you might also need to tick ``Use exported object's size''. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/latexpdf.png}
\label{fig:latexpdf}
\caption{Saving options for \texttt{.tex\_pdf}}
\end{figure}

Bear in mind that from this step and forward, it is the exact process for importing any vector figure you draw with inkscape.

\subsubsection{Importing to \LaTeX}
\href{https://github.com/gillescastel/}{Gilles Castel} created a really concise solution to importing, and we will take advantage of it:

\begin{lstlisting}
\usepackage{import}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{transparent}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\newcommand{\incfig}[2][1]{%
    \def\svgwidth{#1\columnwidth}
    \import{./figures/}{#2.pdf_tex}
}
\begin{document}
    \begin{figure}[h]\centering
        \incfig{laplacian}
        \caption{From \texttt{plot2svg}.}
    \end{figure}
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

Resulting in the following graph.
\begin{figure}[h]\centering
    \def\svgwidth{0.8\columnwidth}
    \import{./Examples/Importing-graphs/vector/figures/}{laplacian.pdf_tex}
    \caption{From \texttt{plot2svg}.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Challenge:}
Import the one generated by \texttt{matlab2tikz} into your document, and see how they compare.
You can see the results in \texttt{Examples/Importing-graphs/vector}.
In this case there is no difference between the two, so it may come down to preference or situations where your graph is not displayed how it should.
