% \section{Introduction}
There are two ways to create a maths environment: math mode and display mode.
\LaTeX\ is usually in text mode, but anything between \verb|$|\dots\verb|$| or \verb|\(|\dots \verb|)\| becomes math mode.
A math environment allows subscripts, superscripts, greek letters and for most things one would associate with mathematics.
\begin{lstlisting}
    In text mode. Now maths: \(x^1+\alpha_0 = y^{2x}\)
\end{lstlisting}

In text mode. Now maths: \(x^1+\alpha_0 = y^{2x}\).

\verb|{}| is how we indicate that everything inside the brackets should be treated together.
This should become clear from the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}
    \( x^12 + x^{12} + x_0^2 + {x_0}^2 \)
\end{lstlisting}
and its result: \( x^12 + x^{12} + x_0^2 + {x_0}^2 \)

\paragraph{Display math} can be done in several ways.
The suggestion is using the \verb|amsmath| package, and either the \verb|align| or \verb|equation| environments.
\texttt{align} numbers every single line, and \texttt{align*} does not. Similarly for \verb|equation|.

To declare a new line, use \verb|\\|, and \verb|&| defines the point in the expression (if any) for horizontal alignment.
\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= (x+1)(x-1) \cdot \left( \frac{\alpha}{\ln 5} \right)\\
        &= x^2 - 1 \left( \frac{3}{\ln 5} \right)
    \end{align*}
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{align*}
    f(x) &= (x+1)(x-1) \cdot \left( \frac{\alpha}{5} \right) + \log_{2} 7\\
    &= (x^2 - 1)  (\frac{\alpha}{5} ) + \log_{2} 7
\end{align*}

The usual product symbol \( \cdot \) is created with \verb|\cdot|. \(\times\), relevant for both cross product and scientific notation, is produced with \verb|\times|.

The pair \verb|\left( \right)| produce parenthesis that fit any vertical size.
You will see the effect of them missing in the second expression.
Similarly, they can be used with \verb|\left\{  \right\}| to fix the size of \verb|{}| and \verb|\left[  \right]| for \verb|[]|.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.40\textwidth}
    \begin{equation*}
        \left( \frac{\alpha}{5} \right) \qquad (\frac{\alpha}{5} )
    \end{equation*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.59\textwidth}
    \begin{lstlisting}
\begin{equation*}
    \left( \frac{\alpha}{5} \right) \qquad (\frac{\alpha}{5} )
\end{equation*}       
\end{lstlisting}    
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Because math environments change the way letters are displayed, \verb|\ln|, \verb|\sin|, \verb|\cos|, \verb|\log|, \verb|\exp| and more can be used to produce the font as we would expect. 

\verb|\frac{numerator}{denominator}| produces the proper fractions \( \frac{a}{b} \). Occasionally you may find \( a/b \) more suitable.

\subsection{Making typing easier}
A few things become very clear: There is a whole lot of syntax to remember; it is very easy to forget something and your \texttt{pdf} won't compile; and big expressions become very complicated to keep track.
Let's highlight how we avoid these problems.

Inserting brackets with the appropriate sizing is made easy with snippets \verb|@(|, \verb|@[| and \verb|@{|.
Type whichever one you want and Intellisense should popup.
Press \verb|tab| and it will even place your cursor in the right spot.
If you expect to put a lot inside those brackets, press \texttt{enter}, and use vertical space + identations to keep everything tidy.

Inserting greek letters in VSCode can be done by typing \verb|@| followed by the first letter of the english name.
Some special letters have a ``variable'' variant, like \(\varphi\) (variable phi) compared to \(\phi\) (phi).
So \(\gamma\) is produced with \verb|@g|, \verb|@f|~=~\(\phi\) and \verb|@vf|~=~\(\varphi\).

Finally, to create the unnumbered \texttt{align*} environment, type \texttt{bsal}, then \texttt{tab} --- \textbf{b}egin, \textbf{s} for unnumbered, \textbf{al}ign.
Similar snippets exist for other environments, such as align --- \texttt{bal}; \texttt{equation} --- \texttt{beq}, \texttt{equation*} --- \texttt{bseq}.
A full list can be seen \href{https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Snippets}{here}.

Don't worry if this doesn't quite make sense. There are some exercises meant to practice exactly this.

\subsection{Organisation}
Let's look at a simple example 
\begin{align*}
    f(x) & = {
        \left( 
            \frac{3+x}{x^{2x}}
            + \left[ \sqrt{x} + \sin(2x) \right]
        \right)
    }^2
    \\
    &= \dots
\end{align*}

The following code snippets describe two approaches to splitting up the expression.
You have a lot of freedom to choose what works best for you, though the suggestion is to use something akin to the second example.
\begin{lstlisting}
f(x) &
    = { \left( \frac{3+x}{x^{2x}} + \left[ \sqrt{x} + \sin(2x) \right \right) }^2
\\
&= \dots
\end{lstlisting}
Compared to:
\begin{lstlisting}
f(x) & = {
    \left( 
        \frac{3+x}{x^{2x}}
        + \left[ \sqrt{x} + \sin(2x) \right]
    \right)
}^2
\\
&= \dots
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Variables}
It is also worth pointing out how to define \LaTeX\ variables.
The motivation is similar to how you would say ``let \(a = e^x+\sqrt{3}\)'' and use \(a\) in the expressions.

\paragraph{Defining a new variable} uses \verb|\newcommand{\command}{expression}|.
With our example, that means \verb|\newcommand{\a}{e^x+\sqrt{3}}|.
Now we can produce the same output by typing \verb|\a|.

\paragraph{Redefining a variable} uses \verb|\renewcommand{}{}|. The point of separating the two is so that you don't accidently define/redefine a variable within the same \emph{scope}.
Variables in \LaTeX\ are bound to their immediate environment.
If this doesn't mean anything, just follow these two two rules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If you need it for only this (set of) equation(s) in particular, define the variable inside the \verb|align| environment.
    \item If you need it across the whole document, set it in your preamble before the \texttt{document} environment.
\end{enumerate}

For anything else in-between, reusing a variable name may require a little trial-and-error.

\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{align} \label{eq:test}
\newcommand{\x}{\alpha+5}
    \x
\end{align}
\end{lstlisting}
Would produce the following result, and we can refer to it by number by using \verb|\ref{eq:test}|.
\begin{align}
    \alpha+5
\end{align}
\subsection{Vectors, matrices and cases}
Vector notation is achieved using \verb|\vec{F}|, producing \(\vec{F}\).
If you prefer bold instead of the arrow \( \vec{F} \implies \mathbf{F}\), redefine the \verb|\vec| variable in the preamble to math bold, like so:
\verb|\renewcommand{\vec}{\mathbf}|.

The \verb|matrix| environment produces matrices without brackets, essentially the same as the \texttt{tabular} environment.
For parenthesis we would use \texttt{pmatrix}; and for square brackets, \texttt{bmatrix}.
The syntax is similar to tables/tabular we covered earlier --- \verb|&| separate columns and \verb|\\| separate rows.
Notice you will need to create a matrix environment inside of a math environment, like below 
\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \vec{F} = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 2 & 3 \\
            3 & 2 & 1 
        \end{bmatrix}
        , \qquad
        A = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\ 2
    \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{align*}
    \vec{F} = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        3 & 2 & 1 
    \end{bmatrix}
    , \qquad %Long space
    A = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ 2
    \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align*}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\end{figure}



Another important environment which has similar syntax is \verb|cases|, which looks like this:

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) = \begin{cases}
            1, x \geq 5 \\
            -1, x < 4 \\
            0, 4 \leq x < 5  
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
    \begin{lstlisting}
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) = \begin{cases}
            1, x \geq 5 \\
            -1, x < 4 \\
            0, 4 \leq x < 5  
        \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

You will notice \verb|\leq| and \verb|\geq| for \( \leq \) and \( \geq \), respectively.
They can be quickly produced with VSCode with the snippets \verb|@<| and \verb|@>|.

The last thing we will cover for maths symbols is calculus.
A full list of symbols native available can be found \href{https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols}{here}.
Many of the most commonly used ones have snippets available in our editor, like \verb|@8| \( \implies \) \verb|\infty| (\( \infty\)); \verb|@2| \( \implies \) \verb|\sqrt{}| (\(\sqrt{} \)); \verb|@-| \( \implies \) \verb|\bigcap| (\( \bigcap \)), and much more.

Finally, there are many options to how one can align and number equations, \texttt{amsmath} has excellent documentation explaining the various cases.
See page 5 \href{https://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/CTAN/macros/latex/required/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf}{here}.

\subsection{Calculus}
Let's typeset derivatives from first principle and integrals from riemann sums.

Try typesetting these yourself, including the organisation! You can find a solution in the \texttt{Calculus} example folder.

\subsubsection{Derivatives}
Given an expression \( f(x) = x^2+5 \), the derivative, \( f'(x) \), from first principle is given by:
\begin{align}
    f'(x) &= \lim_{\delta x \to 0}
        \frac{
            f(x + \delta x) - f(x)
        }{ \delta x }
    \\
    &= \lim_{\delta x \to 0}
        \frac{
            {(x + \delta x)}^2+5 - (x^2+5)
        }{ \delta x }
    \nonumber \\
    &= \lim_{\delta x \to 0}
        \frac{
            x^2 + 2x\delta x + {\delta x}^2 +5 - (x^2+5)
        }{ \delta x }
    \nonumber \\
    &= \lim_{\delta x \to 0}
        \frac{
            \cancel{\delta x} (2x + \delta x)
        }{ \cancel{\delta x} }
    \nonumber \\
    f'(x) &= 2x 
\end{align}

---

The way these have been typeset in this document was to use an \verb|align| environment (a numbered environment) and the \verb|\nonumber| command before each new line I did not want numbered.
All equations are aligned at the equals sign, which we achieve by setting the alignment anchor \verb|&| before the \verb|=|.

\begin{lstlisting}
    f'(x) & = ... \\
    & = ... \\
\end{lstlisting} 

As expected, \( \delta x\) can be written with \verb|\delta x|. Notice the space between both is important, seeing as \verb|\deltax| is not a command itself.

The limit symbol comes from \verb|\lim_{exp}|. The underscore \verb|_| refers to a subscript, and you will see similar notation for integrals, sums and even besides brackets.

Finally, the \texttt{cancel} package provides us with the \verb|\cancel{exp}| command, which puts a strike through \verb|exp|.
It also provides \verb|\cancelto{value}{exp}|, which in a math environment generates \( \cancelto{0}{x+5} \).

\begin{lstlisting}
\cancelto{0}{x+5}
\end{lstlisting} 

Once again, try to replicate it for yourself and see a solution in the \texttt{Calculus} example.

Our options for derivatives are straightforward:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{minipage}{0.40\textwidth}
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{d\ f(x)}{dx} \quad \frac{d^2 }{d x^2} f(x)
            \quad \frac{\partial^3 }{\partial^3 x} f(x,y) \\
            \nabla^2 \vec{f} \qquad \nabla \cdot \vec{\omega}
            \qquad \nabla \times \vec{F}  
        \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.59\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
\frac{d\ f(x)}{dx} \quad \frac{d^2 }{d x^2} f(x)
\quad \frac{\partial^3 }{\partial^3 x} f(x,y) \\
\nabla^2 \vec{f} \qquad \nabla \cdot \vec{\omega}
\qquad \nabla \times \vec{F}  
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\centering
\end{figure}

It's worth mentioning that math environments ignore spaces.
It automatically chooses an appropriate spacing after \verb|+| or \verb|=|, for instance, but sometimes you need to force a space.
Small spaces are done with `\verb|\ |' (note the empty space that follows the backslash), alternatively larger spaces are \verb|\quad| and \verb|\qquad|.

\subsubsection{Integrals}
Let \( f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R} \) be a function defined in the closed interval \( [a,b] \) and with partitions
\begin{equation*}
    P = \left \{ 
        [x_0,x_1], [x_1,x_2], \dots [x_{n-1},x_n]
     \right \}
\end{equation*}
such that
\begin{equation*}
    a = x_0 < x_1 < x_2 \dots x_n = b
\end{equation*}
A Riemann sum \( S \) is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x_i
\end{equation}
Now if \( f \) is integrable within the interval and \( \Delta x_i \) approaches zero, we have an integral:
\begin{equation}
    \int_a^b f(x) \,dx= \lim_{\Delta x_i \to 0}S = \lim_{\Delta x_i \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x_i 
\end{equation}

And finally, if \( F(x) \) is the integral of \( f(x) \), then
\begin{equation*}
    \int_a^b f(x) \,dx = F(x)\Big|_a^b = \Big[F(x)\Big]_a^b
\end{equation*}

---

\paragraph{Note:}
The \verb|align| environment has a peculiar spacing between text and the math display area, which is larger than \verb|equation|, the environment used for these examples.

The uppercase sigma sum symbol \( \sum \) is done with \verb|\sum|.
Intuitively, if you need the pi product symbol \( \prod \), that is \verb|\prod|.
As expected, \verb|_| marks the text to go below and \verb|^| the text that goes above.
Therefore this is what was used: 
\begin{lstlisting}
    \sum_{i=1}^n
\end{lstlisting} 

Integrals use the \verb|\int| tag, with similar sub/superscripts behaviour to sums.
To guarantee a small space between the expression and \( dx \), the suggestion is to use \verb|\, dx|.
The other variants of the integral symbol can be seen below.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{minipage}{0.40\textwidth}
    \begin{align*}
        \int f(x) \,dx \quad \iint \,dA \quad \iiint \oint 
    \end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
\int f(x) \,dx \quad \iint \,dA \quad \iiint \oint 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\centering
\end{figure}

The bar that indicates ``evaluated in the interval \( a \) to \( b \)'', \( \Big|_a^b \), is done by using \verb!\Big|_a^b!.
Note that both \verb|\big| and \verb|\Big| exist, each one referring to a slightly different length. 
A similar syntax can be used for other brackets.
\begin{lstlisting}
    F(x) \Big|_a^b = \Big[ F(x) \Big]_a^b = \Big\{ F(x) \Big|}_a^b
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{equation*}
    F(x) \Big|_a^b = \Big[ F(x) \Big]_a^b = \Big \{ F(x) \Big \}_a^b
\end{equation*} 

\subsection{Theorems, lemmas, corollaries, etc}
While generally not used in an engineering context, you may find the creation of theorems, etc useful:\\

\begin{figure}[h]
    \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
    \newtheorem{corollary}{Corollary}[theorem]
    There is a very famous theorem,
    \begin{theorem}
        Angles of a triangle add up to \ang{180}.
    \end{theorem}
    which can be followed by a corollary
    \begin{corollary}
        The first corollary that follows
    \end{corollary}
    More explanations followed by
    \begin{corollary}
        The second corollary
    \end{corollary}
    \begin{theorem}
        A second theorem
    \end{theorem}
\end{figure}


To create each environment, the syntax is
\begin{lstlisting}
    \newtheorem{environment-name}{display}[numbered-after]
\end{lstlisting}
\texttt{environment-name} is a label.
\texttt{display} refers to the actual text that will be shown --- Theorem and Corollary, with the capitalisations.
\texttt{numbered-after} is from where it should derive the numbering --- \texttt{section}, another theorem, etc.

Then we use the environment like any other:
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{environment-name} ... \end{environment-name}
\end{lstlisting}
This can be placed at any point in your document, though most likely in your preamble.

To create the example above, we did the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{corollary}{Corollary}[theorem]
There is a very famous theorem,
\begin{theorem}
    Angles of a triangle add up to \ang{180}.
\end{theorem}
which can be followed by a corollary
\begin{corollary}
    The first corollary that follows
\end{corollary}
More explanations followed by
\begin{corollary}
    The second corollary
\end{corollary}
\begin{theorem}
    A second theorem
\end{theorem}
\end{lstlisting}
