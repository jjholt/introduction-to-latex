\subsection{Visual Studio Code}
\href{https://code.visualstudio.com/}{Download}

VSCode is a general purpose editor, and if you plan on doing any programming at all, it may be worth becoming more familiar with it.
Microsoft has an excellent introduction to it in their \href{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs}{website}.

In order to give VSCode the ability to work with and compile \LaTeX{}, we must install the LaTeX Workshop extension.
Start by opening the extensions on the side bar (shortcut: \texttt{ctrl+shift+x}).
Search for ``latex'' and the first option should be LaTeX Workshop published by James Yu.

\subsubsection{Compilation}
Unless changed in the settings, your \texttt{.tex} will be compiled on saving the file.
If compile on save does not trigger, you can manually do it with a few different options:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the command pallet (\verb|ctrl+shift+P|), type ``latex build'' and select the option ``LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX Project''
    \item On the top right, while in a \texttt{.tex} file, click the green arrow (\texttt{ctrl+alt+B}).

\end{enumerate} 

\subsubsection{Other}
The LaTeX Workshop extension should also give you access to another tab on the left-hand side.
This includes navigating the document's structure and seeing helpful math symbols.

\subsection{TeXstudio}
\href{https://www.texstudio.org/}{Download}

TeXstudio is an IDE dedicated to \LaTeX{}, so there is minimal setup. Simply download and you're ready to go!

\section{Online editing}
If you need a tool similar to Google Drive/One Drive for online collaboration, the most popular option is \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{Overleaf}.
UCL students and staff have access to professional accounts on Overleaf, and the link to activate it can be found in the software database: \href{https://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/package/view/id/1235}{here}.
