\section{Installing \LaTeX}
Thre are two main options: TeX Live and MiKTeX, both put together all the underlying components that are necessary to create documents.

\subsection{MiKTeX}
MiKTeX can be downladed for Windows, Mac OS and Linux: \href{https://miktex.org/download}{link}.

\subsection{TeX Live}
\href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{Link} to all the instructions.
The web page is pure text, so the navigation can be a little challenging.
Below is some information which links to the appropriate area.

\subsubsection{Mac}
To install MacTeX, follow the instructions \href{https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html}{link}

MacTeX will install TeX Live, plus a few other utilities.
Either of the suggested editors will still need to be installed.  

\subsubsection{Linux}
Your package manager will have a TeX Live distribution. \href{https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TeX_Live}{Link} to the Arch Linux wiki.

Fedora and other RPM based distributions can download it with
\begin{lstlisting}
    # dnf install texlive-scheme-full
\end{lstlisting}

Debian/Ubuntu:
\begin{lstlisting}
    # apt-get install texlive
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Installing an IDE}
\subsection{Visual Studio Code}
\href{https://code.visualstudio.com/}{Download}

VSCode is a general purpose editor, and if you plan on doing any programming at all, it may be worth becoming more familiar with it.
Microsoft has an excellent introduction to it in their \href{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs}{website}.

In order to give VSCode the ability to work with and compile \LaTeX{}, we must install the LaTeX Workshop extension.
Start by opening the extensions on the side bar (shortcut: \texttt{ctrl+shift+x}).
Search for ``latex'' and the first option should be LaTeX Workshop published by James Yu.

\subsubsection{Compilation}
Unless changed in the settings, your \texttt{.tex} will be compiled on saving the file.
If compile on save does not trigger, you can manually do it with a few different options:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the command pallet (\verb|ctrl+shift+P|), type ``latex build'' and select the option ``LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX Project''
    \item On the top right, while in a \texttt{.tex} file, click the green arrow (\texttt{ctrl+alt+B}).

    \end{figure}
\end{enumerate} 

\subsubsection{Other}
The LaTeX Workshop extension should also give you access to another tab on the left-hand side.
This includes navigating the document's structure and seeing helpful math symbols.

\subsection{TeXstudio}
\href{https://www.texstudio.org/}{Download}

TeXstudio is an IDE dedicated to \LaTeX{}, so there is minimal setup. Simply download and you're ready to go!

\section{Online editing}
If you need a tool similar to Google Drive/One Drive for online collaboration, the most popular option is \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{Overleaf}.
UCL students and staff have access to professional accounts on Overleaf, and the link to activate it can be found in the software database: \href{https://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/package/view/id/1235}{here}.
